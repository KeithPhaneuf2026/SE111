            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Keith Phaneuf. I was born on December 16th, 2004, and I am currently in my freshman year at the New England Institute of technology. I am here for a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Network Engineering. While I have not always had an interest in computers, I have always been facinated with technology. I actually never had my own windows computer until April of last year. I earned my license when I was 16 and used to drive a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe which had 160,000 miles. Due to repair costs, I sold it and bought my grandfather's 2005 Buick LaCrosse which at the time had only 96,975 miles. it now has over 107,000 miles. I feel as if this was the best financial desision of my life because I bought a family car that I knew was taken care of for cheap and saved money on repairs. This allowed me to be able to afford my own laptop, which is high end enough to do anything I want to throughout my college career until I graduate. </p>
