                <p>The movie <em>Shrek</em> which came out in 2001 is a fictional movie about an ogre living isolated in his swamp in the fairytale filled world, which includes all of the characters of disney and fairytale stories. The movie starts off showing the life of Shrek the ogre living life how he always has been, which includes nearly complete isolation from the outside world until he humorously scares away villagers who want to capture or kill him. One day, there is an assembly that takes in unwanted fairytale creatures and rewards the people who capture the creatures. One of these animals is a talking donkey turned in by an old lady. However, magic is dropped on the donkey who then briefly levitates and then runs away. Guards chase after him and then he finds and hides behind Shrek who once again scares the guards away. The donkey then thanks Shrek who proceeds to never stop talking which annoys Shrek who justs want to be alone.</p>

                <p>The new formed duo start interacting more as Shrek's property is overtaken by mystical creatures, and Shrek is sent to find the princess. Throughout the movie, we see character growth withinn both Shrek and Princess Fiona. With the help of Donkey, both other characters open up about their true personalites and we learn a valuable lesson as viewers of how deep people's emotions go. This is a very high quality movie that is fun to watch for all ages with high comedic value and valuable life lessons to teach us how to properly interact with ourselves. The movie is engaging throughout. Even with the poorly aged animation, it is an ageless movie. </p>
